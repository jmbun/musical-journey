            <h2>Beginnings</h2>
            <p>
               This is a story about my musical journey.
               As long as I can remember, I've had strong a passion for music.
               When I was younger I played the flute and violin,
               but I've since shifted to making music electronically.
               While I'm not a professional musician,
               I hope to one day compose music for games or other media,
               and although that may be a challenge,
               I intend to get there!
            </p>

            <p>
               When I was 14 years old, I decided to give a go at digital composition.
               Even though it had been a long time since I'd played any instruments, and my musical knowledge was lacking, that wasn't going to stop me!
               Here's one of the first compositions I was proud of, with a fitting name for these early beginnings.

            <h2>Dreams</h2>
            <p>
               From a young age I was fascinated with space,
               to the point that I wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up.
               I'd always dream of what could be,
               discoveries there were to be made,
               technologies yet to be invented.
               I wondered what worlds were out there, waiting to be found.
               I wanted to help others dream too.
               I think music is magical;
               it can transport your mind to another world, it can turn you from sadness to joy, it can make you feel things you wouldn't normally feel.
            </p>

            <p>
               I knew if I had to choose one purpose in life it'd be to inspire people through music just as I had been.
               One of my early influences was Owl City / Adam Young, who's music inspired me in a way that I never had been before, with his dreamy lyrics, and soft synths.
               All of this set the tone for what I wanted my music to be like, and led me to explore the creation of electronic music.

            <h2>Kingdoms</h2>
            <p>
               Another one of my great inspirations is a composer named Adrian von Ziegler, known for his beautiful Celtic music.
               Music creates an ambience, it brings other worlds closer to ours, it's the final touch in making the make believe believable.
               Can you imagine the Lord of the Rings without its breathtaking soundtrack by Howard Shore?
            </p>
            <figure>
               <img src="images/fantasy.jpg">
            </figure>
            <p>
               Von Ziegler's music had me dreaming once more,
               this time of far away places,
               and forgotten lands.
               His music seemed to tell a story through instruments alone.
               I wanted to emulate his style, and evoke the same feelings his music evoked in me,
               which led me to explore creation of instrumental music for some time.
               Although I enjoyed the process, it was a lot more difficult for me compared to electronic music,
               and so it would be a while before I'd return to making this kind of music.

            <h2>Star Diver</h2>
            <p>
               For years I'd kept my music to myself and close friends or family because I felt it still wasn't good enough. Nonetheless, I was determined to get my music out there.
               While I'd created some pieces I was pleased with, I wasn't very consistent, and one important thing I had yet to learn was how to utilize percussion and bass.
               Omitting these things is fine for ambient tracks,
               but not knowing how to utilize them correctly can cause music to sound flat, and the more upbeat ones need, well, a beat.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
               Though I intended to keep creating some ambient tracks,
               experimenting with percussion and bass for the first time began the evolution of my music.<br>
               In 2019, I adopted the alias 'Star Diver' to release my first few songs online.
               Nebula Beach was one of the first songs where I implemented the new things I learned, and although there was room for improvement, it was definitely an important step forward!

            <h2>Evolution</h2>
            <p>
               As time went on I feel as though I began to adopt my own style, though I was still drawing from my early influences.
               By this point I had improved significantly in creating melodies, layering different sounds, and overall in knowing how to properly structure a song.

               I've found I like to incorporate the piano, violin, cello, or similar sounding synths into my songs.

            <h2>Memories</h2>
            <p>
               There seems to be a powerful connection between music and memories.
               It's not always easy listening to music from the past, because it can bring back memories of some rough times.

               The song below has become associated with a lot of nostalgic memories, reminding me a friend I used to talk to a lot, and the fun times we had playing games together.

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>
               Music is still a huge passion of mine, and I'll always strive to improve.
            </p>
            <p>
               In recent years I've been working with on a indie game that I'm also very passionate about!
               It's fantasy themed, and while the kind of music that demands isn't my area of expertise at the moment, I've been exploring instrumental music once more.
               I hope to further my skills to reach the standard that I have in mind for my game. 
            </p>

               <img src="images/future.jpg">
            </figure>
            <p>
               At the moment I can't spend as much time on these things as I'd like,
               but if the opportunity arises,
               I'd like to learn more about music theory and composition. <br>
               I'm still not quite where I want to be,
               but I try not to compare myself to others because I know I'm on my own journey,
               and I'll get to where I want to be, in time.
